  "abstract": "We build an open-source agroforestry potential scoring system using CoRE Stack layers such as cropping intensity, runoff, slope, groundwater stress, and tree cover change. The tool generates tehsil-level score maps, provides village-level summaries, and includes a reproducible notebook that automatically fetches all required datasets using CoRE stack APIs. The outputs are designed to be actionable for watershed planners and community-based organizations.",
