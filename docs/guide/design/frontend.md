# Frontend Implementation Guide

This document provides guidelines for implementing the frontend application that interacts with the Core Stack Backend. It outlines the architecture, components, authentication flow, and best practices based on the API, hierarchy, and database design.

## Architecture Overview

The frontend application should follow a modular architecture that aligns with the backend's organization and permission structure. We recommend using a modern JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js with the following architecture:

### Recommended Architecture

1. **Core Modules**:
   - **Authentication Module**: Handles user registration, login, token management, and session persistence
   - **User Management Module**: Manages user profiles, roles, and permissions
   - **Organization Module**: Handles organization-related operations
   - **Project Module**: Manages projects and their settings
   - **App-specific Modules**:
     - **Plantation Module**: For plantation management features
     - **Watershed Module**: For watershed planning features

2. **State Management**:
   - Implement a centralized state management solution (Redux, Vuex, or Context API)
   - Store authentication tokens, user information, and application state
   - Implement middleware for API calls and token refresh

3. **Routing Structure**:
   - Public routes (login, register, landing page)
   - Protected routes (dashboard, projects, settings)
   - Role-based route protection
   - Nested routing for project-specific views

## Authentication Implementation

The frontend should implement JWT-based authentication as defined in the backend API:

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**:
   - Implement a registration form with all required fields
   - POST to `/api/v1/auth/register/`
   - Store received tokens in secure storage (localStorage, cookies with httpOnly flag, or sessionStorage)

2. **User Login**:
   - Implement a login form with username and password fields
   - POST to `/api/v1/auth/login/`
   - Store received tokens in secure storage

3. **Token Management**:
   - Include the access token in the Authorization header for all API requests:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
     ```
   - Implement token refresh logic when access token expires:
     - POST to `/api/v1/auth/token/refresh/` with the refresh token
     - Update stored tokens with the new ones

4. **Logout**:
   - POST to `/api/v1/auth/logout/` with the refresh token
   - Clear all stored tokens and user data
   - Redirect to the login page

### Token Storage Security

- Use secure storage mechanisms for tokens
- Consider using HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
- Implement token expiration handling
- Add CSRF protection if using cookies

## User Interface Components

### Navigation Structure

Implement a hierarchical navigation structure that reflects the backend's organization:

1. **Main Navigation**:
   - Dashboard
   - Organizations (for superadmins)
   - Projects
   - User Management (based on permissions)
   - Settings

2. **Project Navigation**:
   - Project Overview
   - App-specific sections (Plantation, Watershed)
   - Project Settings
   - Team Management

### Role-Based UI

Adapt the UI based on user roles:

1. **Superadmin View**:
   - Full access to all organizations, projects, and settings
   - Organization management interface
   - User management across all organizations

2. **Organization Admin View**:
   - Limited to their organization
   - Organization settings
   - Project management within their organization
   - User management within their organization

3. **Project User View**:
   - Limited to assigned projects
   - Features based on project-specific permissions

## Data Flow and State Management

### API Integration

1. **API Service Layer**:
   - Create a service layer that encapsulates all API calls
   - Implement automatic token refresh on 401 errors
   - Handle error responses consistently

2. **Data Fetching Patterns**:
   - Implement loading states for all data fetching operations
   - Use pagination for large data sets
   - Implement caching where appropriate

### State Management

1. **Global State**:
   - Authentication state (user, tokens, isAuthenticated)
   - Current organization
   - Global UI state (theme, sidebar collapsed, etc.)

2. **Project State**:
   - Current project
   - Project-specific settings
   - Active app type (plantation, watershed)

3. **Form State**:
   - Form validation
   - Error handling
   - Success/failure notifications

## App-Specific Implementations

### Plantation App

Based on the `PlantationProfile` model and related endpoints:

1. **KML File Management**:
   - Upload interface for KML files
   - Visualization of uploaded KML data on maps
   - KML file listing and management

2. **Plantation Profile Management**:
   - Interface for creating and editing plantation profiles
   - JSON configuration editor for the `config` field
   - Validation based on plantation-specific requirements

### Watershed Planning App

Based on the `Plan` model and related endpoints:

1. **Plan Creation and Management**:
   - Multi-step form for plan creation
   - Geographical hierarchy selection (State, District, Block)
   - Plan listing and filtering

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Interface for adding resources to plans
   - Resource categorization and tagging
   - Resource visualization

## Permission Handling

Implement permission checks throughout the UI:

1. **Component-Level Permissions**:
   - Conditionally render UI elements based on user permissions
   - Disable actions that the user doesn't have permission for

2. **Route Guards**:
   - Protect routes based on user roles and permissions
   - Redirect unauthorized access attempts

3. **Permission Helpers**:
   - Create utility functions to check permissions
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // Check if user can edit a project
     const canEditProject = (user, project) => {
       if (user.is_superadmin) return true;
       if (user.organization === project.organization && 
           user.groups.includes('Organization Admin')) return true;
       return user.projectPermissions[project.id]?.includes('edit_project');
     };
     ```

## Error Handling and Validation

1. **Form Validation**:
   - Implement client-side validation for all forms
   - Match validation rules with backend requirements
   - Display clear error messages

2. **API Error Handling**:
   - Implement consistent error handling for API calls
   - Display user-friendly error messages
   - Log detailed errors for debugging

3. **Offline Support**:
   - Consider implementing basic offline functionality
   - Queue operations when offline
   - Sync when connection is restored

## Performance Optimization

1. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Implement code splitting for routes
   - Lazy load heavy components

2. **Data Optimization**:
   - Use pagination for large data sets
   - Implement infinite scrolling where appropriate
   - Cache frequently accessed data

3. **Asset Optimization**:
   - Optimize images and other assets
   - Use CDN for static assets
   - Implement proper caching strategies

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual components
   - Test utility functions and helpers

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test component interactions
   - Test form submissions and API interactions

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Test complete user flows
   - Test authentication and authorization

## Deployment and CI/CD

   - Configure environment-specific builds
   - Optimize build output for production

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Set up automated testing
   - Lint code during CI process

3. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - Automate deployment to staging and production
   - Implement rollback strategies

## Security Considerations

1. **XSS Protection**:
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Use framework-provided protection mechanisms

2. **CSRF Protection**:
   - Implement CSRF tokens for forms
   - Follow best practices for your chosen framework

3. **Secure Communication**:

   - Implement i18n framework
   - Extract all UI strings for translation

2. **Localization**:
   - Support date and number formatting
   - Consider right-to-left language support

## Conclusion

This frontend implementation guide provides a comprehensive framework for building a frontend application that integrates with the Core Stack Backend. By following these guidelines, developers can create a robust, secure, and user-friendly application that leverages the full capabilities of the backend API while maintaining proper authorization and permission controls.

The modular architecture allows for scalability as new app types are added to the system, and the role-based UI ensures that users only see and access the features they have permission to use.
