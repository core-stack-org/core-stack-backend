While drainage lines are essential to plan assets such as check dams located on the drainage lines, it is also important to identify areas outside of the drainage lines that are under the influence of drainage lines. We use digital elevation model (DEM) data that provides pixel level information on the elevation and drainage lines (with stream orders) as inputs to compute stream order rasters. Areas with higher stream orders are those downstream of areas with lower stream orders, and can help identify cropping regions like low-land, mid-land, and up-land.

Alluvium
Laterite
Basalt
Sandstone
Shale
Limestone
Granite
Schist
Quartzite
Charnockite
Khondalite
Banded Gneissic Complex
Gneiss

Precipitation data has been obtained from JAXA’s Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Evapotranspiration data from FLDAS Noah land Surface model by NASA and USGS, and runoff has been computed on a per-pixel using slope-adjusted CN numbers, the hydrological soil group, and LULC.
